Documentation WIP.

Quick start:

* Get Google Maps API Key: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/directions/
* Get DarkSky API Key: https://darksky.net/dev
* Copy sample.env to .env, and add the keys from the above services
* Copy sample_config.json to config.json, and add in your home location and destination(s).
* `yarn install` to bootstrap dependencies
* `yarn build` (to generate the compiled payloads)
* `yarn start` (for proxying service calls & running the app)
* By default, it will run on http://localhost:3001/

This was generated with create-react-app, and hasn't been ejected yet.
