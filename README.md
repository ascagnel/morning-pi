Documentation WIP.

Quick start:

* Get Google Maps API Key: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/directions/
* Get DarkSky API Key: https://darksky.net/dev
* create a ./src/config.json file based off of ./src/sample\_config.json, fill in keys and data
* `yarn start` (for proxying service calls)
* `yarn dev` (to run the app)

This was generated with create-react-app, and hasn't been ejected yet.
